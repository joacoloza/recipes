        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This spinach artichoke dip is delicious. It's so cheesy and fragrant. If you don't like artichokes, don't worry</p>
        <p>you'll never know they're in there! My only question is: Is it okay to eat it with a spoon right out of the dish?</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, peeled and minced</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a small baking dish.
             <li><p>Mix cream cheese, mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, Romano cheese, garlic, basil, garlic salt, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl. Gently stir in artichoke hearts and spinach.</p></li>
            <li>Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish; top with mozzarella cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and lightly browned, about 25 minutes</li>
        </ol>
